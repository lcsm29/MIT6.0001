# make a folder for git and go to the folder
git init

# generate key. do not change the default name or path for the key. just press enter when it's asking for location/filename. 
# default location is %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/id_rsa (which usually is /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# look up for public key and register the key on github.com account settings
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa (or ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

# start ssh-agent and add your private key
eval `ssh-agent -s` (or start ssh-agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# adding repo
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
# if it has been added via HTTPS, then;
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

# and the last step
git config --global credential.helper 'store --file %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/id.rsa' 


Linux difference
default location would be /home/you/.ssh/id_rsa
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
and probably the last step isn't neccessary on Linux
