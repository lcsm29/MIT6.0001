**Beware!** :eyes: This is not only my first attempt at learning Python, but also my first time at programming as well as Git. Thus, be prepared to see horrible code and commit history. The original intent of using GitHub was to provide a complete history of mistakes and progresses, but I managed to wreck some early portion of file history by moving folders around without thinking. However, the commit history for those files still exists, and is visible.

## Some Random Info
* üìÖ **Started** on March 29, 2021
* üèÅ **Finished** on May 18, 2021 (Problem Sets)
* ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Python Versions I used**: [3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) (macOS), [3.9.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-394/) (Ubuntu), [3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/) (Windows)
* ‚≠ê **Recommended version**: Python 3.8. I made a small [change](https://github.com/lcsm29/MIT6.0001/commit/c53684d2d6d06465bd0d08087161be7b7d529ee4) on feedparser.py, because it produced an error on Python 3.9, but I'm not sure whether it was an adequate fix or not. If it's inadequate, revert back the change and use Python 3.8 to avoid the error
